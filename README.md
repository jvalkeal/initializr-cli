# initializr-cli
Experimental `CLI` for [initializr](https://github.com/spring-io/initializr) implemented with [spring-shell](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-shell) defaulting to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io). Focus of this `CLI` is to make it more user friendly to create a project from a command line and also demonstrate _native_ capabilities with [spring-native](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native).
