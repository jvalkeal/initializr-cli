= initializr-cli

Experimental `CLI` for https://github.com/spring-io[initializr] implemented with https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-shell[spring-shell] defaulting to https://start.spring.io[start.spring.io]. Focus of this `CLI` is to make it more user friendly to create a project from a command line and also demonstrate _native_ capabilities with https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native[spring-native].

== Build

NOTE: Use either JDK11 or JDK17

Normal build without _native_:
```
./gradlew clean build -x test
```

Which you can then run with:
```
java -jar build/libs/initializr-cli-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

For native build:
```
./gradlew clean build nativeCompile
```

NOTE: You need to have `GRAALVM_HOME` pointing to your _graal_ installation

Which you can then run with:
```
./build/native/nativeCompile/initializr-cli
```
